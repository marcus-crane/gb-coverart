### Videogame Cover Art search powered by Giant Bomb

My site hosting expires soon and I'm probably going to move so I thought now would be a good time to back up some of my old projects to Github.

I made this when I was back in school, around 2010 perhaps?

All it does is send an API request to Giant Bomb and return the associated cover art.

It took me ages though since I didn't understand to traverse XML (gross, right? I didn't know JSON was a thing back then)

### Requirements

All you need is a free API key from Giant Bomb and a server to host the PHP files
